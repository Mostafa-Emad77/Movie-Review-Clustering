# Movie Review Clustering

## Overview

This project is aimed at clustering movie reviews into different groups based on their sentiment scores. By employing sentiment analysis and clustering techniques, we aim to categorize movie reviews into positive and negative sentiment clusters, allowing users to gain insights into the overall sentiment of the reviews.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews.
- **Clustering:** Applies K-means clustering algorithm to group movie reviews into clusters based on their sentiment scores.
- **Visualization:** Provides visualizations to showcase the distribution of reviews across different sentiment clusters.
- **Scalability:** The system can handle a large volume of movie reviews and efficiently cluster them.
